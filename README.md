# Project: Participant Management with TypeScript

This repository contains the implementation of a participant management system as part of the "Web Engineering" module. The project emphasizes learning JavaScript/TypeScript, object-oriented programming, and test-driven development with Jest.

## Project Description
The project focuses on creating a `Teilnehmer` class to manage participant statistics, including methods for:
- Registering participants
- Retrieving the last, minimum, maximum, and average participant counts
- Tracking changes in participant numbers

The implementation avoids the use of arrays and achieves high code coverage through comprehensive testing.

## Features
- Object-oriented design in TypeScript
- Test-driven development with Jest
- Code coverage of 98% or higher

## Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or newer)
- npm (v8 or newer)
